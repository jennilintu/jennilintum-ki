            <h1>Cruelty-free Cosmetics</h1>
            <p>Cruelty-free cosmetics are cosmetics that have not been tested on animals. Although most advocates for cruelty-free cosmetics agree that none of the ingredients used in the production of the cosmetic can be tested on animals in order for it to be truly cruelty-free, despite the fact that many companies who brand themselves as such still use materials that have been tested on animals. They are still benefiting from previous data that was conducted on animals.</p>

            <p>People often think that if a cosmetic product is labeled vegan, that must mean no animals were harmed, right? Not really, vegan doesn’t always mean it is cruelty-free. The term cruelty-free only implies to animal testing. The term Vegan only implies to the use of animal-derived ingredients. Cosmetics can be both cruelty-free and vegan, or only one or neither. Thus not all cruelty-free products are actually free from cruelty, as cruelty-free does not mean the product is free of all animal ingredients. To completely keep animals out of your cosmetics, make sure that products are not only cruelty-free, but also vegan.</p>

            <h2>Animal testing</h2>
            <h3>Why do some companies still test on animals?</h3>
            <p>Harsh chemicals, synthetics, and toxins commonly used in beauty formulations must be tested in order to be deemed safe for human application. This isn’t so much a government oversight as it is the cosmetic company itself wanting to avoid any potential lawsuits. Animal tests still continue because some companies want to develop and use new ingredients. These are ingredients that do not have existing safety data — because they are new. So new safety data has to be generated to satisfy the regulators before a product can go on sale, and that means new animal testing.</p>
